Stay Cozy with the Good Eats

# Description
Our idea is to merge the Yelp and Airbnb datasets to help food-loving individuals make a more informed decision about where they want to stay in NYC. Our web app will combine information about the restaurants near each airbnb or output areas with the best airbnbs based on certain criteria. Users would be able to search airbnb locations and see the average rating or price metrics near that spot. Perhaps we would also create an interactive map or let users search by food type.
